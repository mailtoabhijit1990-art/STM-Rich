# Sleep Tracking Game - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Reference-Based with Gaming Elements

Drawing inspiration from successful wellness and sleep tracking apps (Pok√©mon Sleep, Sleep Cycle, Headspace) combined with mobile game patterns. This sleep tracking game prioritizes engagement through gamification while maintaining a calming, restful aesthetic.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Calming and soothing visual language appropriate for sleep/wellness context
- Game mechanics that reward consistency without creating stress
- Clear data visualization that makes sleep patterns instantly understandable
- Minimal cognitive load for logging sleep (should be effortless)
